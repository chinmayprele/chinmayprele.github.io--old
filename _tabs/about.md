I am primarily interested in understanding how network architecture can affect the evolution of genes within it. We will be using a combination of multiple -omics data including transcriptomes, genomes, and metabolomes to create an organismal-scale net- work to study the effect of each factor on the evolution of genes surrounding it. We plan to also use transposons to guage what role each type has on the evolution of genes closer to it in the network, and in the 3D conformation of the genome. We will be using species within the Drosophila phylogeny as our model organisms.
I hope to expand what I learn about genomic network structure to Hominidae in the future.
